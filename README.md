# Laptop-price-Analysis

This project analyzes and compares laptop features with respect to their prices. The dataset contains both categorical features (e.g., company, type of laptop, CPU, GPU) and numerical features (e.g., RAM, weight, touchscreen, PPI). The objective is to uncover patterns and insights in the relationship between laptop features and their prices.

The app provides an interactive way to explore these relationships and visualize how different features impact the price of a laptop.

# Key Features
Data Cleaning: The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed using NumPy and pandas.
Visualization: Insights are visualized through graphs comparing features like RAM, CPU, and weight against the laptop price.
Streamlit App: An interactive app built with Streamlit to explore and visualize the data.

# App Interface
The app displays different visualizations, such as box plots and scatter plots, comparing laptop features with price.
Users can interact with the app to filter and view specific data points.
